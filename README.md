# EmpathAI — Enhanced Mental Health Support Companion

This enhanced EmpathAI prototype includes:
- multi-turn conversational loop
- simple sentiment scoring and context compaction
- session & long-term memory (in-memory demo)
- observability (logs, traces, basic metrics)
- modular structure ready to extend into multi-agent/MCP/A2A flows
- sample Jupyter notebook for demo/testing

**Run locally**:
```bash
python main.py
```

**Notes**: This is a demo scaffold. Replace stubs with real LLM calls, persistent DB, and validated safety models before production.
